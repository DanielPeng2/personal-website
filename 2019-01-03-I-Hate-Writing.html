            <h1>I Hate Writing</h1>
            <div class="date">January 4th, 2019</div>

            <p>That's the mentality I've had throughout most of my life.</p>

            <p>I was one of those "math" kids in my K-12 schooling. I despised English class, especially the assignments that were given to us. Writing all of these analytical essays of classic books felt like a waste of time, I never felt like I learned anything, and the grading schemes just seemed so subjective. Whenever I handed in an assignment, the grade I got back seemed to hinge upon luck. So, I never had any motivation for these assignments and writing them felt like an eternity.</p>

            <p>When I chose to study Computer Science at Waterloo, I thought I was getting as far away as possible from these dreaded writing experiences. In a way, I was right. I no longer have to write thousands of words analyzing books from hundreds of years ago. However, I've since come to appreciate writing in a different light.</p>

            <h2>What changed?</h2>

            <p>It started with reading the blogs of other people in my field, mostly upper-years from Waterloo. I was incredibly impressed by how well written and how thoughtful these articles were. These people were knowledgable about their topics, but also wrote in a way that was clear, professional, and friendly towards the reader. Their blogs presented themselves as smart, accomplished people, and made me want to read more of what they wrote.</p>

            <p>I gained a lot of respect for these people who could write effectively. This led me to realize that writing was a powerful tool &mdash; in different ways than I previously considered.</p>

            <h2>Why I wrote about this.</h2>

            <p>One of my goals for this blog is to become a better writer. I have realized that it is an important skill to have for all fields, and the best way for me to get better at it is with practice. I want to get better at putting my ideas into writing and I want to develop a unique writing voice that is distinctly mine.</p>

            <p>Hopefully, I can find the time throughout the school term to write about topics that I am interested in. I've never really written for fun before and it probably won't be easy (I rewrote the opening paragraph to this post probably around 20 times), but I am excited to see where it goes.</p>
