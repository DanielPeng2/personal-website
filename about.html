            <h1>I'm Daniel.</h1>

            <p>I'm currently a second year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.</p>

            <p>I really like to learn and write programs that can help others - especially if I can make it look nice too! Come check out my projects on <a href="https://github.com/danielpeng2">GitHub</a> or take a look at my <a href="assets/resume.pdf">resume</a>. If you'd like to chat, send me an <a href="mailto:danielpeng2@gmail.com">email</a> or connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-peng/">LinkedIn</a>!</p>

            <h2>Some more about me.</h2>

            <p>In my free time, I like to watch hockey/basketball, listen to music and podcasts, and stay up to date on politics. I also love to run. It's a great way to stay fit and explore the city around me.</p>

            <p>I'm a bit of a mechanical keyboard and pencil hobbyist. I'm currently using a Cooler Master tenkeyless with Jelly POM keycaps and brown switches. In my collection, I have amassed pencils from Rotring, Kuru Toga, and more!</p>

            <p>I'm also a huge Android fanatic. I have experience with Android development (check out some of my apps <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Daniel+Peng">here</a>) and I love keeping up withthe latest Android news.</p>

            <p>I've spent countless hours tinkering with my phones to get them just the way I want them. Experimental custom ROMs, flashing custom kernels, bootloops, I've seen it all. I also like theming my phone homescreens to keep the design feeling fresh.</p>
