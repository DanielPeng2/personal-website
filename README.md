# danielpeng2.github.io
My personal website, created with HTML, CSS, and JQuery.

Come take a look at [danielpeng.ca](danielpeng.ca)! (Warning: still in development)

## What I Learned
* This was my first real front-end web dev project, so it helped me get a lot more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* How to create a responsive website. Seeing as this was my first attempt, I'm not sure about how well it will scale into the future, but I'm happy with the outcome right now.
* Designing is hard! Prior to developing, I decided to make a wireframe of my website in Adobe XD so that I wouldn't have to design in the browser. I did not expect it to take as long as it did.
